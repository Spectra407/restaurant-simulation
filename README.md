# restaurant simulation
 Python program that simulates the reservation of a table, ordering from a menu, and eating food at a restaurant.
 The reservation happens in the console where you will enter your First Name and Last Name. A table will be assigned after correctly entering this information in the interface that pops up.
 Afterward, you choose items in the menu by inputting their name, for example : "soupe", "gratinée", "steak", "café".
 After eating the food that will be presented in front of you, a receipt will be printed for your meal.
